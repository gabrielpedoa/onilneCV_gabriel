      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        With over one and a half years of focused experience in backend
        development, I have successfully contributed to projects with varied
        architectural frameworks. My expertise lies in JavaScript and
        TypeScript, where I have built robust RESTful APIs, meticulously crafted
        unit tests, and integrated complex systems from initial concept through
        to ongoing maintenance. I thrive on tackling challenging problems and
        continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills within
        the technology domain.
